## Final Products

Our project worked pretty well, and we were really happy that the demo worked.

The main task was to find a path in a custom build maze with green construction
paper.

There were two AR tags, one will be on the TurtleBot, the other one will put in
the maze. With the help of the camera on the side to provide information of the
maze and the position of the TurtleBot and the goal by using both AR tags.

After integration, the TurtleBot is able to find the shortest path from the
starting point to the goal and moves to the goal in many different settings of
the maze.

### Changed Path and Moved Goal - The yellow TurtleBot successfully follows the goal with a dynamic path

During the early morning of our demo presentation, we completed a new version
of our code, but we did not have time to test it thoroughly, so we decided to
use an older version instead of the latest one. The day after our presentation,
we returned to the lab and made some changes to the code to finish our final
product. The latest code allows the TurtleBot to be able to follow the goal
even if the maze is changed and/or the goal is moved. During our presentation,
we could only change the goal position while the maze was fixed. The video for
this recent change is the following video:
